Thought this might be helpful for some of you. If you don't have an SEO plugin that handles it you can edit your theme.liquid file and add something like this:

  {% comment %} Handle certain pages manually which aren't available in the backend such as all products {% endcomment %}
  {%- if collection.title == 'Products' -%}
  {% assign seo_title = "INSERT PAGE TITLE HERE" %}
  {% assign page_description = "INSERT PAGE DESCRIPTION HERE" %}
  {%- endif -%}
  
  
  
  I added it right before the opening title tag so it would set those variables before the theme file requested them:

  {% comment %} Handle certain pages manually which aren't available in the backend such as all products {% endcomment %}
  {%- if collection.title == 'Products' -%}
  {% assign seo_title = "INSERT PAGE TITLE HERE" %}
  {% assign page_description = "INSERT PAGE DESCRIPTION HERE" %}
  {%- endif -%}
  <title>{{ seo_title | strip collection.title }}</title>
  {%- if page_description -%}
    <meta name="description" content="{{ page_description | escape }}">
  {%- endif -%}
